# Chapter 6: High-level API in TensorFlow

The high-level API in TensorFlow mainly refers to `tensorflow.keras.models`.

This chapter introduces the following details related to `tensorflow.keras.models`:

* Model constructing (using `Sequential`, functional API, or the child class of `Model`)

* Model training (using pre-defined `fit`, `train_on_batch` methods, customized training loops, single GPU training, multiple GPU training, and TPU training)

* Model deployment (using tensorflow serving for deployment, using spark (scala) for using tensorflow models)
