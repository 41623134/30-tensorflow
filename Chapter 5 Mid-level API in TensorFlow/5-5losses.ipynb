    "In general, the target function in supervised learning consists of loss function and regularization term. (Target = Loss + Regularization)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the keras model, the regularization term of the target function is usually designated in each layer, such as using `kernel_regularizer` and `bias_regularizer` parameters in `Dense` layer to sepecify using l1 or l2 norm. On the other hand, `kernel_constraint` and `bias_constraint` parameters can limit the range of the weights, which is also a method of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss function is designated during the compilation of the model. For the regression models, the most popular loss function is the mean squared error `mean_squared_error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For binary classification model, the most popular loss function is binary cross entropy `binary_crossentropy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For multiple classification model, when the labels are one-hot encoded, we should use categorical cross entropy `categorical_crossentropy` as loss function; for the category with ordinal encoding, the sparse categorical cross entropy `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` should be used as the loss funcion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may define customized loss function when necessary. The customzed loss function requires two tensors `y_true` and `y_pred` as input,and it output a scalar as the value of the caluclated loss function.\n"
